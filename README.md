# DisableFlagSecure

An [Xposed Framework](http://repo.xposed.info/module/de.robv.android.xposed.installer) module that disables [`FLAG_SECURE`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager.LayoutParams.html#FLAG_SECURE) on windows system-wide. This lets you take screenshots and do screen capture in apps that normally won't let you. (That said, you probably don't want to leave this on permanently).
